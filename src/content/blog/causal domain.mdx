# Causal Domains

A causal domain is a collection of things that are linked by cause-and-effect relationships

Similar to ideas of frame of reference

If two observers are at opposite ends of our universe, and we know they will never observe a single particle that will travel anywhere close to the other, do they have the same passage of time, laws of physics? How much of our universe is a function of the observer effect
Could these observers, in independent(?) causal domains, be considered to exist in parallel worlds?
## Causal Domain Shear
There are separate Cosmi, universe $A$ and universe $B$, with time independent of each because they are separate causal domains. Can a single photon that escapes from one to the other cause synchronization of A and B?
