**Context**: I had applied to 11 CS PhD programs for the Fall 2024 cycle and got rejected from everyone of them
</Callout>

I'm writing this because I'm quite proud of where I am currently out after the sting of unsuccesful app cycle, and hope my experiences might help others going through similar things.

In 2023 I decided I wanted to pursue AI research. I was 4 years out of school, enjoying but not loving my job, and was really inspired by all the breakthroughs in machine learning going on around me.
I decided I wanted to dedicate myself to research too, and spent quite a bit of time planning, preparing, writing essays, digging up old connections, and networking. 
This blog post will focus on the rejections themselves.

## Nov-Dec 2023
- Submitting all apps
- Acceptance that the whole app process iss a crap-shoot

## Jan 2024
- Sweet relief
- Know its too soon to hear back anything

## Feb 2024
- First bad sign - no word from any programs about interviews
- Start talking about the possibility of full rejections with family and friends, they reassure me its too soon to hear back

## March 2024
- Still no positive news, no interviews
- First rejection from MIT - totally expected so doesn't bother me, but it is a dream temporarily squashed
- Rejections from CMU - totally expected, but there goes more programs

## April 2024
- More rejections, all the "top programs" I applied to
- Family getting worried, telling me I still have a great chance of remaining schools
- Begin personally confronting the possiblity that I got rejected from everywhere - feel a bit numb
- Hit the point where I should have heard back from all schools but four programs still haven't gotten back to me

## Early May 2024
- Still have not heard back from all schools
- Feel it in my gut I didn't get in anywhere
- Awkward talks with friends who also applied to grad school, them telling me to keep my hopes up

## Late May 2024
- Finally get final rejections
- Feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders
- At first numb reaction, hardest part is telling family - they immediately go into "action" mode "what went wrong", "what are you doing for next year", "you must not have done x,y,z"
- Strong urge to pull away from having to think about it
- Week of wallowing
- Mainly feel embarassed I told so many people about my plans and now need to explain what happened - everyone asks about it and I feel obligated to tell them
- Get injured at gym so can't regulate emotions the same way
- Renroll in therapy
- Message professors and programs asking for feedback
- Get ghosted everywhere

## Early June 2024
- Have second and third therapy sessions
- Reiterate my personal reasons for applying in the first place; know I will try again
- Finally connect with a real human in academia and get some great feedback thanks to this [blog post](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/) I found through reddit and get actionable feedback
- Take a hiking trip to Colorado with friends and my girlfriend
- Feeling way more positive overall - and much more creative
- Start working with a software engineering friend of mine on somec oding projects
- Start building personal projects, including a web scraper and this website
- Reach out to PhDs at my work who meet with me
- Get back in the gym

## Late June 2024
- Meet with professors recommended to me through work connections
- Work is going well
- Start getting involved in research with my comapny's PhD summer interns
- Continue working on personal projects related to ML
- Get more feedback on my personal statement and programs

## General Advice
- Take the time to wallow, sometimes feeling bad is okay, just be conscious about how much time you need (a week, a month, I wouldn't go past that)
- It can feel so dehumanizing to not have anyone at the opposite end of the glass ceiling to reach out to; try to find at least one academic to talk to you and give you advice
- Don't jump directly back into apps, take your time to heal your wounds, and ease back in with personally important creative projects; productive things that make you happy
- Close friends are important - know who will give you good advice and the reassurance you need, not all advice and reactions will be positive
- Reaffirm why this is important to you; don't lose sight of why you love this field
