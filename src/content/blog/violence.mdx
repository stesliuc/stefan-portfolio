### Dune
<Quote>The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it.</Quote>

### Ender's Game
<Quote>The power to cause pain is the only power that matters, the power to kill and destroy, because if you can't kill then you are always subject to those who can, and nothing and no one will ever save you.</Quote>

## Controlled Violence:
### Martial arts as a philosophy:
System of knowledge
Moving your body and mind in concert
Control over yourself and of a resisting figure
Two bodies of water flowing around a structure

Its important to believe in yourself, mindset is extremely key

If you don't think you can beat your opponent, you **never will**

Similarly in combat sports, a love of violence is inherent, a brashness and willpower
This can be an amazing tool to compete better, win more, and even create change in the world, but it also has an ugly side you have to be mindful of, it can escape from combat sports and make you lash out in other aspects of your life
